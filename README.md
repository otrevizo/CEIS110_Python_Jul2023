# CEIS110 Python

_University Teaching: Introduction to Python - July 2023._

This repository contains Python code that supplement the lessons from CEIS110 in July 2023.

## Modules: Python topics

The lessons are organized in modules. Each module introduces the student to different softare topics using Python: 
Control structures, iterative processes, functions, data structures, modular design, i/o, plotting, and analytics. 

I use Jupyter Notebooks to walk the students through the CEIS110 Python code 
following a simple step by step approach. Keep it simple.

The student can then take these notebooks as examples and apply them to build their own Python code
and solve CEIS110 labs and exercises.

I am also sharing one single Python file created on Spyder IDE to broaden the student's knowledge.
Spyder is a powerful IDE that provides several features to code in Python.

## Course Project: Weather use case

The course project adds new functionality to a Python program week over week. The project consists of a use case
that; gathers weather data from NOAA, uses Pandas to build dataframes, uses a SQL database to store the data, 
writes to CSV files to share the data, and creates plots to analyze it. 

The students use Spyder to build the project.
