# CEIS110 Python

_Teaching Introduction to Python - July 2023._

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that supplement the lessons from CEIS110 in July 2023. And Python files that cover to cover the course project.

## Jupyter Notebooks

The lessons are organized in modules. Each module introduces the student to different softare topics using Python: 
Control structures, iterative processes, functions, data structures, modules, plotting and analytics, and i/o, and visuals or plots. 

The purpose of using Jupyter Notebooks is to walk the students through the CEIS110 Python code 
following a simple step by step approach. Keep it simple.

The student can then take these notebooks as examples and apply them to build their own Python code
and solve CEIS110 labs and exercises on their own. The class requires 

## Course Project: Python files

The course project adds new functionality to a Python program week over week. The students use Spyder to create the project.
